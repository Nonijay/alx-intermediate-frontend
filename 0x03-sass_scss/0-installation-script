# Installing sass 
I know sass to be a css preprocessor that is essentially css with super powers. With this css can do so much and still keep your code dry, clean and well indented. 
Sass has the use of variables, mixin, functions, nesting. 
# step 1: I visited the official sass website and navigated through the install navigation link.
    - I Opened my VS code,
    - I opened the parent folder where i would install sass.
    - Navigated to a new terminal or by perssing the ctrl + shift + `
    - Inside the Terminal I typed in <code> npm install -g sass </code>
    - I got notification of changed packages and opted with a <code>npm fund</code>
    - This was further confirmed when I got another return of the folder I am working on.
    - I entered the code sass 0-debug_log.scss output.css
